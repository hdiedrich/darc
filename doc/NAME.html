<h1>Jeanne d'Arc</h1>

<p>"d'Arc" (in this case, pronounced "<strong>dork</strong>") is the name of the beloved national French heroine who rallied her countrymen's spirits to recover their homeland in the 100 Years War against the English. She led the French army to several glorious victories, was captured by the Burgundians, sold to the English, found guilty of witchcraft by the Church and burned at the stake when she was 19 years old. Is that sad? Twenty-five years after, the Pope pronounced her innocent, declared her a martyr and some centuries later she was pronounced a Saint. </p>

<p>Is there a lesson in that?</p>

<p>So "d'Arc" is neither an acronym nor an abbreviation, but a name. Like most names, it should be written the way the authorities ask you to, in this case, "d'Arc". Yes, it's complicated, but worth it. Please do not write it as "DARC", which is both ugly and confusing, because then it becomes an acronym with different meanings for different people. So, please, write "d'Arc" right! Especially when creating folder names. And file names. God is watching. You must do things the right way.</p>

<p>The d'Arc project was inspired by the exuberant welcome to the contribution of Fleece at the ever open-minded Lua mailing list, by the high arbiters of proper software engineering, defected and asylumed there from their Java past at project Dark Star it was rumored. Therefore, the "J" of Jeanne is an intended pun on Java. Oh wait, not, it was the sound-wise association of "d'Arc" with black magic! Or, so very sad to even hint at, maybe the connection was the burning at the stake, by the righteous worhsippers of the true faith? Those, who will turn around and endorse as saintly what they attacked as evil incarnate when it was still young, vulnerable and full of ideals? How this never gets old. Mankind is <em>so</em> doomed. Whatever.  </p>

<p>I am sure Jeanne (19), is watching from the High Heavens and loves d'Arc. From the woods, this is to You!</p>
